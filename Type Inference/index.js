// Inference means that the TypeScript compiler will automatically infer the type of the property value
var name1 = "Mazhar";
// here name1 is the automatically inferred as string type
name1 = 3;
// i can't give number value as it already inferred that it is string
// 2 
var favNumber = 1324;
favNumber = true; // Not allowed
